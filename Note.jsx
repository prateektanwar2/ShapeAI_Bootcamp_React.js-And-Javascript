      <h1>JAVASCRIPT & REACT.JS BOOTCAMP</h1>
      <p>
        This was an amazing Bootcamp taken by Shaurya Sinha. We learnt
        everything from scratch. We learned about Javascript, React.js and HTML.
        This bootcamp helped us to enhance our knowledge and made us aware about
        new things. In future also we would love to attend more such bootcamps
        and would also share it with our friends. It was a wonderful experience.
